        <p class="p-5">Maximalism is by no means a modern trend; maximalists have existed across the globe for
            centuries. "Wealthy people throughout history have practiced forms of maximalism as ways to showcase their
            riches," notes Alessandra Wood, vice president of style at interior design service Modsy. "One of my
            favorite examples of this practice can be traced to 16th-century cabinets of curiosities." The items placed
            on display would vary—first, animal specimens were popular, while in later years, individuals chose to
            highlight artwork and other goods, Wood explains. "Cabinets of curiosities were like small, private museums
            that were stuffed top to bottom with treasures," she adds. "Every surface covered with something."

            As time went on, maximalism emerged once again during the Victorian era. "The Victorians loved the material
            world, and they lived during a time when consumable goods became much more accessible and affordable," Wood
            notes. "Every inch of their homes was covered with some decorative element from wallpaper to rugs to drapery
            to decorative accessories. As a culture, they invested in the idea that each person had their own
            personality and [the] maximalist element of their homes reflected an attempt to showcase their private
            selves to visitors."

            Maximalism's Recent Popularity
            Wood believes that maximalism in today's society certainly takes a cue from past eras. "First, those who
            decorate in that style are like curators of their own space, hoping to showcase a collection of goods they
            love," she notes. "Second, they are more likely than people who love other styles to believe that their
            space reflects their personality."


            And the style has seen a resurgence in more recent years due to economic regrowth, explains Dawn Cook,
            co-owner of BLDC Design. "After the recession of 2008, design trends turned to minimalist—making a statement
            with less," she sha</p>
